Throughout this course you will discover how artists:
-- represent place and take inspiration from their environment,
-- create works of art to express, explore, and question identity,
-- use everyday objects to challenge assumptions about what constitutes a work of art and how it should be made,
-- and respond to the social, cultural, and political issues of their time through works of art.

Through the discussion forum prompts and peer review assignment, you will also have the opportunity to connect with other learners and explore how these themes resonate with your own life and experience.', '{"Methods and Statistics in Social Science - Final Research Project","ICT in Primary Education: Transforming children''s learning across the curriculum","Introducción a Java","Evaluating Designs with Users","Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models","Managing Your Health: The Role of Physical Therapy and Exercise","Violences et religions","Age of Cathedrals","Site Reliability Engineering: Measuring and Managing Reliability","Multiplatform Mobile App Development with React Native"}', 'http://example.org/book?boat=berry', 7, 899, 32, 'https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/92/b0/8292b087090a311714e62de321694ef7.jpg', '{"Anyone frederick placed portions occasion","Capitals thinking","Increasing michigan civilisation pillow entrenched christians achilles scuttlebutt","Reviewed skeleton postpone continual regard coral suspicion issued fever didst","Working what seamen genus quivered understood wellnigh hatch clanged ambiguous","Circumstantial years steed tambourine priests"}', 'MA&I_4B', '{"Aside boiler tears plunged","Dorchester knows","Halters leathern","South pollard drooping showers","Seemed trusive accuracy"}', '03:00:00-06', '17:15:00-06', '2046-10-15 00:28:10+00', '2048-12-19 11:39:38+00', 'a4e45e5b-654d-4915-bb1c-d5c7bc60ef1d');

We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - "Euthyphro", "Meno", "Republic" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology. 

Platonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher''s mouth. You''ll get a feel for it.

We have a book: the new 4th edition of "Reason and Persuasion", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don''t worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.) 

The book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.

The course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons. 

The results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress.

In this course, we explain how to optimize the people, teams, projects, and finances for which you are responsible. 

Despite your research training, you are probably facing an urgent training gap in leadership and management skills. Scientific careers falter for non-science reasons when researchers fail to execute a scope of work: struggle to track expenses and returns substantial unspent grant funds; or run out of funds by spending on the wrong people or mismanaging the right people. Consequently, projects close with inadequate progress on aims, thus compromising successful competition for future funding. This course will help avoid these traps.

Course Syllabus

Overview 

‘From Climate Science to Action’ is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate challenge, and how you as an individual can take action to avoid a warmer world!

Week 1:  Climate Change in the 21st Century

•  Historical and projected observed changes in the climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century
•  The potential of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21 from 187 countries to induce climate action
•  Trends in climate change impacts, including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity 
•  Possible responses from natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification

Week 2: Sectoral and Regional Impacts

•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each of the world’s regions
•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations 
•  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the need for urgent action now

Week 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change

•  Region-specific discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building climate resilience

In this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themes—mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room—so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  

Successful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world.

While population health is largely produced outside of healthcare settings themselves, the functioning of healthcare, including diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness, injury, and other impairments, is essential for people’s wellbeing. Yet, healthcare can be and often is insufficiently accessible, responsive, and efficient for different members of society. How can healthcare provision and society be bridged?
Through the exploration of a combination of theoretical and practical perspectives, this online course highlights the necessity of a dialogue and collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and the public at large. Course participants will critically explore challenges posed by disjunctures between healthcare and society, analyze both benefits and unintended consequences of bridging the two, and propose ways to accomplish the bridging in practice of healthcare provision.

After completion of this course you will be able to:

1.	Recognize disjunctures between healthcare provision and society
2.	Be aware of consequences of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society
3.	Identify opportunities for bridging healthcare provision and society, using a biosocial approach to health
4.	Analyze cases of disjunctures between healthcare provision and society, and propose opportunities for bridging
5.	Recognize the historical trends of scientification, professionalization, and medicalization, in the relations between medicine, health care, and society.

This course will explore sustainable cities as engines for greening the economy. We place cities in the context of sustainable urban transformation and climate change. Sustainable urban transformation refers to structural transformation processes – multi-dimensional and radical change – that can effectively direct urban development towards ambitious sustainability and climate goals.

We will connect the key trends of urbanization, decarbonisation and sustainability. We will examine visions, experiments and innovations in urban areas. We will look at practices (what is happening in cities at present) and opportunities (what are the possibilities for cities going forwards into the future). We bring together a collection of diverse short films and key short readings on sustainable cities as well as interactive forums and a practical assignment to create an online learning community.

This course provides key examples of activities to promote sustainable cities in Scandinavia, Europe and around the world. We utilize films and reports by WWF, the Economist Intelligence Unit, ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, UN-Habitat, C40 Climate Leadership Group, Arup, Sustainia, the Rockefeller Foundation, and ongoing research projects.

You identify opportunities in your daily life to increase the wellbeing by using knowledge you developed in the first four courses of the Specialization. In this final project, you evaluate the efficacy of a positive intervention based on subjective and objective measures. Then, you compare how empirical and non-empirically-based positive interventions can be applied to influence a person''s wellbeing. Lastly, you reflect on how the fundamental elements of research methods are important in the everyday application of positive psychology.

A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.

Recommended Background:
Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Elementary knowledge of RC linear circuits (at the level of an introductory physics class).', '{"إستراتيجية الأعمال المتقدمة","Predict Gas Guzzlers using a Neural Net Model on the MPG Data Set","Методы и инструменты системного проектирования","Chino básico: Cómo dar una primera impresión positiva","Desarrollando tu musicalidad"}', 'https://www.example.com/basket?blade=bells&apparel=badge', 7, 999, 16, 'http://www.outdoor-photos.com/_photo/4417467.jpg', '{"Spreads terribleness aggregate cataract oriental delivered saucers passion irritated balancing"}', 'VCPIL_74', '{"Neighbouring dripping surges"}', '01:00:00-07', '15:15:00-07', '2022-01-31 19:03:57+00', '2023-07-12 23:17:03+00', '0278dfb9-7654-4899-9d01-a0a1c608b69f');

　　房屋為我們遮風避雨，讓我們安心工作、生活，而結構系統又是房屋的骨幹，讓房屋能站的又高、又直、又穩。你知道橫者為梁，直者為柱，但你知道在結構工程師的眼中，梁與柱有什麼其他的不同嗎？他們其中藏著什麼秘密，能支撐起整個結構？工程師要怎麼決定梁該有多深？柱該有多粗？該用矩形、圓形還是其他形狀？該用實心還是空心？在有地震的地方，設計上是否又有不一樣的考量？
　　材料力學是通往上述問題解答關鍵的一步。在材料力學(一)裡，我們會由大家熟知的虎克定律開始，以蓋房子的重要材料「結構鋼」為例，深入探討「力量」與「變形」這兩個令結構工程師愛恨交加的物理量之間的關係。然後依序探討結構桿件受軸力（拉/壓）、受扭、受彎、受剪四大外力作用下，會在桿件內部產生怎樣的相對應變形與受力，並探討建築結構設計概念與提供桿件設計演算範例。
　　本課程是希望精通「鋼筋混凝土設計」、「鋼結構設計」、「木構造設計」者必備的先修課程，也為對「彈性力學」有興趣者，提供許多基礎知識與這些知識如何實際應用於工程設計。
主要授課對象為土木、建築相關從業人員與在學學生，其他包括工學院各科系同學或對材料力學有興趣的人士，也歡迎選修。

Las personas que viven en situación de discapacidad presentan mayores niveles de deprivación en diferentes ámbitos: inserción al mercado del trabajo, nivel educacional, etc. 

Esto nos obliga como sociedad a repensar nuestro trabajo en esta materia desde un enfoque que garantice igual trato para todos. Pues, una sociedad que espere promover igualdad de oportunidades y espacios de desarrollo para todos sus miembros, debe poner especial atención con aquellos sectores que han sido postergados durante generaciones, esto ocurre con especial fuerza en nuestros países del tercer mundo. No obstante comprender el actual enfoque de Derechos permite orientar la acción hacía planes y programas que permitan garantizar accesibilidad e inclusión social para personas en situación de discapacidad.


Nosotros buscamos promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad, por lo que los estudiantes que desarrollen este curso desarrollen una mirada crítica de las prácticas de apoyo de las personas en situación de discapacidad. Posterior a 10 años del nacimiento de la Convención sobre los derechos de las personas con discapacidad, se hace urgente su difusión, comprensión y crítica por parte de los ciudadanos a objeto de modificar prácticas que hoy resultan contradictorias, ilegítimas e innecesarias, las que suelen atentar, en contra de la autonomía y derechos de las personas con discapacidad.

El propósito del curso es promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad.

The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.

Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.

Una población de posibles soluciones de un problema dado es análoga a una población de organismos vivos que evolucionan cada generación, al recombinar los mejores individuos de la población y transmitir sus características de dichos individuos padres, a sus descendientes. En este campo, diferentes esquemas de métodos evolutivos se han desarrollado, los cuales difieren en el tipo de estructuras que conforman la población.
Algoritmos evolutivos (AE), como también se le conoce al cómputo evolutivo (EC), se definen como métodos de optimización y búsqueda, los cuales están inspirados y tratan de imitar de manera parcial los procesos de la evolución natural, y mantienen una población de estructuras que evolucionan de acuerdo a reglas de selección y otros operadores genéticos, como cruzamiento y mutación (Bäck, 1996).
Los algoritmos evolutivos no son los únicos métodos de optimización propuestos a partir de sistemas biológicos. Se tiene una variedad de algoritmos de optimización, que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales, como las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimización por cúmulos de partículas, entre otros. De aquí surge lo que se conoce como algoritmos bioinspirados, ya que toman sus bases a partir de la estructura de procesos y sistemas biológicos: la evolución, la selección natural, comportamiento social de animales, como las hormigas, abejas, peces.

The courses in this series will help you prepare for the Unity Certified 3D Artist exam, the professional certification for entry- to mid-level Unity artists. 3D artists are critical to the Unity development pipeline. They are a bridge between the programmers writing the application code and the designers or art directors who define the application’s aesthetics and style. In these courses, you will be challenged to complete realistic art implementation tasks in Unity that are aligned to the topics covered on the exam.

In this third course, you will complete work on the Kitchen Configurator application - an app that lets users view a realistic rendering of a kitchen and swap out objects and materials to customize the design. Now you’ll work on the allowing users to actually interact with your beautiful design. You’ll implement a User Interface (UI) in Unity and add some pre-written scripts to the project to make it interactive. Finally, you’ll adapt the project to VR with by bringing the UI into world space. By the end of the course, you’ll have a functioning Kitchen Configurator app that would be ready to take to the final stages of production and launch.

This is an intermediate course, intended for people who are ready for their first paying roles as Unity 3D artists, or enthusiasts who would like to verify their skills against a professional standard. To succeed, you should have at least 1-2 years of experience implementing 3D art in Unity. You should be proficient at importing assets into Unity from Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools, prototyping scenes, working with lighting, and adding particles and effects. You should also have a basic understanding of 2D asset management, animation, and working with scripts.

Our nation’s healthcare system is changing at a rapid pace. Transformative health care delivery programs depend heavily on health information technology to improve and coordinate care, maintain patient registries, support patient engagement, develop and sustain data infrastructure necessary for multi-payer value-based payment, and enable analytical capacities to inform decision making and streamline reporting.  The accelerated pace of change from new and expanding technology will continue to be a challenge for preparing a skilled workforce so taking this training will help you to stay current in the dynamic landscape of health care.

This course is one of three related courses in the HI-FIVE training program, which has topics on population health, care coordination and interoperability, value-based care, healthcare data analytics, and patient-centered care.  Each of the three courses is designed from a different perspective based on various healthcare roles.  This first course is from a clinical perspective, geared towards physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, clinical executives and managers, medical assistants, and other clinical support roles.

In asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography, the sender and the receiver use a pair of public-private keys, as opposed to the same symmetric key, and therefore their cryptographic operations are asymmetric. This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course; the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.

Creativity can be developed and refined, albeit with effort and practice. The first goal of this course is to provide a variety of experiences and activities with the aim of developing the creative abilities of each participant. A second goal is to understand the importance of creativity from a consumer perspective. Consumers are being offered more and more opportunities to customize their products and services, and are increasingly seeking to express their creativity through their purchasing choices. As entrepreneurs, we have the ability to shape the consumer environment in ways that help consumers enhance their own creative abilities, and develop a unique relationship with them as a result.

This course is aimed at anyone who wants to understand what we actually know (as opposed to what we think we know) about human creativity, and how to use this knowledge to think differently and productively about business challenges. As the focus is on creativity as a cognitive function, it does not matter what your background is, what industry you come from or want to enter.   

After completing this course, past students report having acquired a set of strategies that enable them to tackle business problems with a fresh perspective.

Целью курса является знакомство слушателей с основными понятиями макроэкономики, с базовыми моделями и принципами, которые используются при анализе текущего состояния экономики той или иной страны, что позволит самостоятельно ориентироваться в происходящих процессах и явлениях, а также проводить оценку эффективности и необходимости проводимой государством макроэкономической политики.

Данный курс покрывает на базовом уровне все основные темы макроэкономики. Примерно две трети курса посвящены анализу общего равновесия на рынках труда, заемных средств, финансовых, денежных, товарных рынках, а также международных потоков капитала. Изучается долгосрочный экономический рост, идущий за счет накопления капитальных мощностей и технического прогресса.  Вторая часть курса посвящена изучению природы краткосрочных колебаний вокруг долгосрочной траектории роста, таким как финансовый кризис и мировая рецессия 2008-2009 годов. Обсуждаются причины подобных спадов, а также оптимальная стабилизационная политика государства, призванная либо предотвращать подобные катаклизмы, либо сглаживать последствия от них.

Для успешного прохождения курса желательно (но не обязательно) иметь базовые знания по микроэкономике.

Many authors and pundits claimed that the world was converging towards a market-friendly democratic place, while gurus and consulting firms were not short of formulae and advice on how to make profits out of the global economy. Decades later, new realities show that globalization does not mean political, cultural, and economic convergence and that forces against it are strong.

This course seeks to help you understand the forces of globalization and how cross-cultural management and the relationship of a multinational organization to various host countries is becoming more and more critical in today’s global economy. This course begins with the discussion of these issues and global relationships and delves into a deeper understanding of business strategy in today’s global business marketplace.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
•	Understand how we got here and why it matters
•	Understand the complexities of the current globalization (not all countries are the same)
•	Evaluate the effects of international trade regulations on international business
•	Evaluate when and why should we operate as multinationals

Through the real-life story and data of a leading cookware manufacturer in North America, you will learn the data analytics skills for demand planning and forecasting. Upon the completion of this course, you will be able to  

1. Improve the forecasting accuracy by building and validating demand prediction models. 
2. Better stimulate and influence demand by identifying the drivers (e.g., time, seasonality, price, and other environmental factors) for demand and quantifying their impact.

AK is a leading cookware manufacturer in North America. Its newly launched top-line product was gaining momentum in the marketplace. However, a price adjustment at the peak season stimulated a significant demand surge which took AK completely by surprise and resulted in huge backorders. AK faced the risk of losing the market momentum due to the upset customers and the high cost associated with over-time production and expedited shipping. Accurate demand forecast is essential for increasing revenue and reducing cost. Identifying the drivers for demand and assessing their impact on demand can help companies better influence and stimulate demand.

In this project-centered course* you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.

What you’ll need:
This is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.

Course format:
The course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module''s lectures, and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling "nand2tetris TED talk".

Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground. A privileged point of view of our course is the ancient Phoenician city of Motya, located exactly at the centre of the “sea in the middle”. Throughout the live experience of excavation, with images taken on the field, this course will let you touch the many tesserae of the great mosaic of the Mediterranean Civilization.

We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther’s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.
 
We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas’ great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin’s Geneva to Elizabeth’s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.
 
Christianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God’s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story.

This course introduces you to the necessary sections of probability theory and statistics, guiding you from the very basics all way up to the level required for jump starting your ascent in Data Science. 

The core concept of the course is random variable — i.e. variable whose values are determined by random experiment. Random variables are used as a model for data generation processes we want to study. Properties of the data are deeply linked to the corresponding properties of random variables, such as expected value, variance and correlations. Dependencies between random variables are crucial factor that allows us to predict unknown quantities based on known values, which forms the basis of supervised machine learning. We begin with the notion of independent events and conditional probability, then introduce two main classes of random variables: discrete and continuous and study their properties. Finally, we learn different types of data and their connection with random variables.

While introducing you to the theory, we''ll pay special attention to practical aspects for working with probabilities, sampling, data analysis, and data visualization in Python.

In particular, we take note of the cultural and religious transformations that characterized the city with a special effort to understand how many peoples and religions came to settle and live amongst one another. We will virtually-tour the Islamic and Christian structures of the Museo de Santa Cruz, Iglesia de San Román, Sinagoga del Tránsito, Mezquita de Bab al-Mardum, Archivo Municipal de Toledo, and the Archivo Historico de la Nobleza.

We examine the Visigoths transition from Christian Arianism to Catholicism and the harsh treatment of the Jewish population. We explore Islamic governance and development of the medieval city of three faiths, with a special interest in its cultural achievements. We will study King Alfonso “The Wise” (1252-1284)’s efforts to characterize himself as the “king of three religions” via his legal codices, the creation of the Cantigas de Santa María, and his intellectual endeavor known as the Toledo School of Translators. We evaluate the robust Jewish and converso noble families of the city and appreciate their intellectual, religious, and economic contributions to Castilian life. We will bear witness to the rise of anti-Jewish blood purity statutes, the creation of the Inquisition, and the expulsion of the Jews. We also briefly introduce and study Spanish manuscripts from the municipal and cathedral archives to make new scholarly breakthroughs relating to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim interrelations.

Tables are great for data storage. The concept of organizing data in rows and columns is familiar to most people. Accountants use spreadsheets to organize financial data, making it easier to budget and track expenses. Parents use lists with columns to track their family’s schedules so that everyone gets to participate in outside activities. Even the Internal Revenue Service gets in the game by using tax tables to provide tax amounts for a variety of incomes. Even a simple grocery list is tabular in nature. Each row is an item, with one column having the item''s name/description, and a second column noting the quantity needed. It’s no surprise that database designers like to use tables in a relational database to organize and store data.

The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming.

Accounting and finance are indeed intertwined. Sometimes people that are not experienced in the area even mix them up. But most often emphasis in accounting is on numbers. Still, the deep understanding of key accounting concepts helps reveal the interests and actions of people behind these numbers. And the human dimension of accounting adds invaluable insight in the potential of successful project implementation.

This Course discusses core ideas and concepts of both financial and managerial accounting. It by no means pretends to be comprehensive to any extent. But, being rather an accounting overview, it focuses on the issues that are most relevant and important for effective valuation of investment projects.

The learners will gain insight into the essence of accounting. They will be able to use the obtained knowledge and skills to successfully advance in their career at a financial institution, as well as in the area of financial management at non-financial businesses.

An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. 

Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.

Tasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  

Tasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.

Tasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.', '{}', 'https://www.example.com/basket/achiever.php?boot=beginner', 6, 799, 12, 'https://facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Van-Gogh-Starry-Night.jpg', '{"Imminent thoroughfares vehicle threemasted transferred incorrect hakluyt","Watery pulverise thing annihilation frequented nooks","Christendom rafts certainty seventeenth bridle offensive outer vibration pistols","Perse promise abound starboard cashier thumb regarded crescentic barbs scotch","Mischief cheeseshaped averse mirror towns twentyfour clenched fortress girls marrow dangerous","Decks mowers eastward swiftness accuracy remove masked knocking","Procured planet tenth propellers","Silvery peering whereas","Searching pallid having milky besides town advent clamour maritime dogged continual","Annihilation goadings simultaneously began accompani","British morbid barbarians prairies powers softly loses secondly interests controls","Trusive saucers transcendent stantive probability demanding purge barren yarns haply","Tokened statues walrus","Steamengine expandingly backwoodsman identify ignorance refuse frozen inshore","Craggy overheard lettered ideas distinguish repeating scatter accomplishing wight","Worlds integral sidering"}', 'SDCMM_9H', '{"Interesting holds","Legerdemain anguish intents whether","Fiendish pausing","Hoods peeped unsus","Instances banks testaments perverse","Divides planet ignorance","''narwhale allowing sensation carries","Demand victories brance"}', '03:45:00-07', '13:00:00-07', '2034-01-03 09:15:36+00', '2040-11-14 23:32:46+00', 'a272f52b-265d-452e-8c7a-a3a0e6f7da40');

The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.

"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: 
(1) The excess burden of taxation
(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax?
(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve
(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model
(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing
If you haven''t done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: "Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.

The course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.

The course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:
• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;
• Technology as the engine of economic growth;
• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?

The curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard''s Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.

After successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:
• better understand economic issues presented in the media
• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies
• define and measure inequality and poverty
• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth
• explain the foundations of economic growth
• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals

All these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.

LMEs occupy areas of coastal ocean at least 200 000 km² or greater in size. These coastal waters produce 12.6 trillion USD in ecosystem goods and services annually and are vitally important for billions of people around the globe.

Because LMEs are bounded by ocean features and are globally linked, management of human activities needs to occur in an integrated fashion across political boundaries and economic sectors (e.g. fishing, shipping, energy, tourism, and mining.) This represents a new type of management approached - shifting from single sector-based to multi-sector assessment and management within the spatial domain of the world''s 66 Large Marine Ecosystems. There is global high-level support for this new approach and in this course, we will introduce the concepts and tools for assessing and managing LMEs.

Together, leaders and experts in a global movement to recover and sustain the goods and services of LMEs will introduce you to the mechanisms used for assessment (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis), planning and implementation (Strategic Action Programme). Based on recent activities in implementation and practice of the LME approach in 22 projects around the globe, we will showcase examples of effective management at this scale, and highlight the challenges and issues. By the end of the online course, we hope you will be able to actively use this knowledge to advance sustainable development of the world’s oceans.

In less than a century more than 1 billion people have been urbanized. That translates into the fact that more than half of the world’s population is already living in cities. Experts forecast that very soon Africa will become one of the most urbanized continents. However, almost 70% of world’s urban population is living in the cities where governments are struggling to provide basic services like sanitation, schools, hospitals, and adequate clean water. 

The reason is that, their governments do not have enough money. This may also be true also for the city where you live or work. Poor infrastructure affects your daily life. Local governments struggle with mobilizing finances so that they can improve your quality of life but many times they are not aware of the right mechanisms. 

Imagine that your government wants to know how can they finance cities and they want you to advise – where will you begin with? Our finance experts are bringing their experience right at your Desk through this MOOC. This MOOC has five modules and in five weeks you will learn:
•	Financial decision making environment in urban systems
•	Mechanisms for mobilizing local revenues
•	Innovative mechanisms for financing infrastructure projects through partnerships, and 
•	Financial decision making under uncertainties and risks

We will provide you a carefully selected set of literature, quizzes and interactive discussion forums. So join our MOOC and find out the ways to make your city a better place to live in for yourself and for your next generations.

How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? 

Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, République et Canton de Genève, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

By the end of this course, you will be able :

- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions
- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies
- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions
- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health 
- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.

Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

This MOOC on “Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern” was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.

The course begins with simple vocal placement in a mix, where you will also learn the fundamentals of compression and equalization. You’ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio. 

Through analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You’ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto-Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, VocAlign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations. This course gives students a thorough look at the expanded choices that have risen in the art of vocal production as a result of these modern tools.

The goal of the course is to help interested novices understand the recordings they are listening to, performers find an expanded language for their recorded voices and for vocal producers to be able to create musically artistic visualizations using singers as their paintbrushes.', '{"Accounting for Decision Making","Marketing Gerencial","Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services"}', 'http://example.com/bait/agreement.htm?boy=apparel&attack=bed#brass', 6, 499, 30, 'https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/92/b0/8292b087090a311714e62de321694ef7.jpg', '{}', 'TAoVP_79', '{"Elusive bloody coast","Heavy treacheries","Medioc finding quitting","Where cough imposing hours"}', '04:30:00-06', '19:30:00-06', '2030-07-11 23:50:52+00', '2032-05-02 12:20:22+00', '29a4531c-7e53-453a-a8d1-e3c8979874ef');

There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.

This seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives.', '{"市场营销概论 (中文版）","Python Data Visualization","Cómo autoconstruir tu vivienda","Software Development Processes and Methodologies","Major Engineering Projects: Governance, Risk and Scope","America''s Written Constitution"}', 'https://example.com/', 6, 699, 28, 'http://www.outdoor-photos.com/_photo/4417467.jpg', '{"Being statue quivered incensed cluny believed wayside furious spell"}', 'TBUaPaAAF_Lm', '{"Contrasting corpulence toppling","Elijah faces inmates","Coerced palmy","Bearded plaza sides vishnu","Barbary eagerly needed","Discreetly images cedar southward","Human keeping milestones","Pictorial underground"}', '00:45:00-06', '14:00:00-06', '2038-06-14 07:38:37+00', '2044-11-03 17:02:41+00', '3de3715a-700d-4ccd-95e9-e55c1d386cc5');

It may be useful for professional psychologists, for specialists whose activity involves empathy, inspiration, understanding and creating of daily life, and for all who are interested in the topic. 

The main idea of the course
Genius, talent and golden mediocrity are different (perpendicularly oriented) dimensions of human existence. They should be studied coherently with their manifestations. All together they construct a space for creative life, but each taken separately provokes traumatic, devastating and exhausting forms of anxieties. Our course shows how these three dimensions manifest themselves in life and how you can fulfill your genius, abilities, talents more fully and completely.

Our Method
We critically examine the manifestations of the studied "dimensions" (phenomena), in order that by putting off all "the supposed" we could find specific and inherent meaning. The phenomenological method is to understand and express in simple terms the fundamental structure of creative activity, to express everything that was, that is and that will be important in the psychology of creative life.

Course objective
Our main objective is a phenomenological description of genius, talent and golden mediocrity as specific dimensions of human life, correction of errors and misapprehensions of common sense regarding these phenomena.

What you gain
After taking this course you will know what it is to be genius. You will see the phenomena of mediocrity and talent in a new light. You will understand these phenomena better based on our various examples. You will also be able to practice various aspects of these dimensions of creativity in your daily life.', '{"Continuous Delivery & DevOps "}', 'Middleworth', 8, 99, 18, 'https://www.artinconnu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/monalisa.png', '{}', 'GTGM_AP', '{"Mouths mainyard recognition"}', '06:00:00-06', '19:15:00-06', '2029-02-17 12:13:55+00', '2031-02-10 22:44:02+00', '03e9856c-8a21-4097-a5af-6a5c632b2f27');

Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?

The course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.', '{"Disability Inclusion in Education: Building Systems of Support ","The Modern World, Part One: Global History from 1760 to 1910","Supply Chain Operations","Launching into Machine Learning en Español","Supply Market Analysis","Drugs and the Brain","Разработка интерфейсов: финальный проект","Politics and Economics of International Energy","Evolution: A Course for Educators","Advanced Manufacturing Process Analysis","Hands-on Text Mining and Analytics"}', 'https://example.com/', 0, 399, 22, 'https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/david-irvine-cover.jpg', '{"Heinousness spirally mysteries shallows astern waving pierce sleeps casting","Superstitious report retreating fifteen rowed bishop cornfield demand interfusing sounding","Unstaked fights bowieknives define pinetree distantly silverspoons master swimming nor'' delivered","Purposes fulllength leader throbbings equally carriage casks narrating swinging","Mast seethings morally corroborated hootings transparent respectively hardy thieves chased","Aimed foibles action fibres levelled chasm yawned mortar studied","Absent meditation theless","Pedestal taller sober vacated supernatural independent pliny shops","Dashed observatory dismember thickgilt interior gations intellectual rumours mighty","Aught brook freebooting besieged cruisinggrounds included sighting pudding lowered shaking"}', 'ItSB_hm', '{"Conquered signal","Instigation roman","Fireengines simultaneously setting deavour","Bedford fullers sorcery","Ontario statues","Parlour forecastle","Headway envoy withdraw greenness"}', '06:00:00-08', '19:30:00-08', '2037-03-15 04:14:45+00', '2043-09-07 01:49:24+00', '08a74bb4-c965-463b-b2d1-77f75cd72c9b');

MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME.

Human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us – physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.

Learning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.

In this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.

All of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.

The sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  

We hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.

Это происходит благодаря тому, что клетки помнят эту информацию и вовремя «включают» и «выключают» нужные гены. Клетки могут помнить даже то, занимаетесь ли вы спортом и как часто употребляете алкоголь, как чувствовала себя ваша мама, когда была беременна вами, и какими вирусными инфекциями вы переболели в детстве. Такую способность, как клеточная память, изучает эпигенетика. О том, как активность генов влияет на работу клеток и всего организма в целом, мы расскажем вам в нашем новом онлайн-курсе «Эпигенетика. Краткий курс по управлению генами».
Посмотрев наш курс, вы точно не перепутаете эпигенетику с родственной генетикой, ведь в то время как первая только «предполагает», как поведут себя ваши гены, вторая «располагает» механизмами их управления. Вы узнаете, существует ли эликсир «вечной молодости», и что происходит с клетками, когда мы стареем? Зачем нужны стволовые клетки и смогут ли они продлить нам жизнь? Почему нам нужны хромосомы от обоих родителей? Вы увидите, как устроена клеточная память, и как её можно использовать для лечения некоторых сложных заболеваний. А ещё мы расскажем вам, как поймать преступника с помощью эпигенетики. 
Наши преподаватели расскажут вам очень много удивительных вещей о строении клеток и работе организма. Вы сможете больше узнать о собственном здоровье, здоровье своих будущих детей, а также о передовых технологиях, которые уже используют учёные, чтобы сделать мир лучше.

We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
•	Explain how different market structures result in different resource allocations.
•	Model the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out.
•	Evaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.  
•	Explain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets.
•	Describe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.
•	Understand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.

Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. 

The course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions – and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. 

The entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete. Completion certificates are issued on the basis of participation in all 6 modules. 

What you''ll learn: 
-	How the Charles Perkins Centre recruits interdisciplinary teams to ease the burden of chronic disease
-	How a complex systems approach is necessary to provide solutions to a complex problem
-	The fundamentals of chronic disease research and where it is heading
-	The biggest risk factors for chronic disease and their global incidence
-	The biological, genetic, social, regulatory, and other influences that have inflated these risk factors
-	How to provide solutions globally for the reduction of chronic disease', '{"Practical Introduction to the Command Line","Mathematics for Computer Science","Business Process Management in Healthcare Organizations","Forecasting, Budgeting, Territories, Evaluation and Legal/Ethical Issues","Mastering Final Cut Pro","Internet of Things Capstone: Build a Mobile Surveillance System","Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 2",程序开发项目实践,"Construction Cost Estimating and Cost Control","Дипломный digital-проект: руководство к действию","I/O-efficient algorithms"}', 'Hollowville', 10, 199, 22, 'https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/92/b0/8292b087090a311714e62de321694ef7.jpg', '{"Sympathetical flitting blending fiend","Lurked domestic words cuvier pelled","Superstitiously alleghanies","Grand dread outriders danger whales spouting instead horrible castors impressions","Nostrils intermitting wonderful venture tation george walks oriental","Coleridge maddens besides merchant disgust primal narrating repartees cascade dragged courage","Induced potency","Solitude lowered gentlemen volcano never filefish fowls tradi despair refining resides habituation","Maintaining encamped timeliest hoisted","District consist passiveness pledge gentlemen thwack crackled","Polar plunging"}', 'Etboodacd_6F', '{"Sustain furnishes conveyed gleams","Collapsed books controls","Groves extending","Walls moonlight sides easily","Venetianly stamping intangible manoeuvres","Holyofholies ought unbelief lance","Closely recklessness reaching narrates","Colonies exasperations"}', '03:00:00-08', '13:30:00-08', '2038-12-23 08:19:23+00', '2048-06-11 21:08:12+00', '15f66c71-a4ca-47f1-8535-0239d43a2692');

This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it.
 
What is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to “substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution”? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.

During the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment. It is a global responsibility to combat the health impacts of air pollution, and this fight can only be won through new knowledge and global collaboration.

If you are the parent of a newly admitted college student and curious about what college life is like, this course is also for you. 

While your specific college will, no doubt, provide additional orientation material, we wanted to give some basic information about what life might be like at a large American University. You might be years away from college or enrolled right now; either way, U101 has some excellent advice from college students, professors, administrators, and staff.

At the conclusion of the course, learners should:
1. Understand the basics of how colleges and universities operate. 
2. Identify and describe what faculty are looking for in college-level academic work. 
3. List some effective study strategies. 
4. Identify some strategies for exploring and selecting a major. 
5. Identify the various types of grants and scholarships available and describe the steps involved in applying to these.
6. Discuss the college life, with special attention to the benefits/limitations of living on or off campus. 
7. Identify some strategies for getting the most out of campus life activities (investigating student clubs, fraternities, sororities, etc.).

The course is divided into 4 weeks/8 lessons, which provide an overview of the different aspects of college life. If you were just watching the videos and looking at some of the links, the whole course would take about 4-5 hours.

It uses natural learning processes to make learning the languages easy.  Simple first examples are presented, then language rules and syntax, followed by more complex examples, and then finally use of test bench simulations to verify correctness of the designs.  Lecture presentations are reinforced by many programming example problems so that skill in the languages is obtained.

Neuroeconomics provides biologists, economists, psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions and how others decide. Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.

The course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.

The course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures and taking quizzes, you will receive an invitation to join our forum. We plan to join the discussions in the forum on a weekly basis.

This course will introduce you to inbound and provide you with a big picture view of everything you need for a successful inbound strategy.

So, why inbound?

Inbound is a fundamental shift in the way you do business. Instead of an interruption-based message where the marketer or salesperson had all the control, inbound is about empowering potential customers. Consumer’s buying behaviors have changed and will continue to change. That''s the driving force behind inbound. What your customers want today is different than what they wanted 10 years ago. That means you need to change the way you market, sell, and service to match the way people actually want to shop and buy.

So, wondering what to expect in this course?

After an initial lesson on an introduction to the inbound fundamentals, the course consists of a set of lessons that follows the inbound methodology. The inbound methodology illustrates the four stages that make an inbound business. It reflects the entire inbound marketing, sales, services, and relationship process. The stages are Attract, Convert, Close, and Delight.

Each lesson includes different tactics that you can apply to help you and your business grow better.

This requires business professionals with a vision, the right knowledge and skills. This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business’ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.

“Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we’re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.”

Téa Obreht, 
The New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.

It is a frightening prospect indeed – that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed. This course is about landscape degradation – a global and wicked problem that is contributing to the dooming prospect of depletion of Earth’s finite resources. But this course is also about the solutions to this problem – business driven landscape restoration.
So rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations. 
We must act big and we must act now.
With this course we want to pass on valuable knowledge and teach you useful skills that you can apply in your professional life that will enable you to tackle the issue of landscape degradation and restoration. 
The issue is urgent, so let’s dive right into it.

Why logistic regression for public health rather than just logistic regression? Well, there are some particular considerations for every data set, and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention. In a word, they''re messy. Like the others in the series, this is a hands-on course, giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life, messy data, with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally, the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesn’t just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said, much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set, so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to: 
Explain when it is valid to use logistic regression 
Define odds and odds ratios 
Run simple and multiple logistic regression analysis in R and interpret the output 
Evaluate the model assumptions for multiple logistic regression in R 
Describe and compare some common ways to choose a multiple regression model 

This course builds on skills such as hypothesis testing, p values, and how to use R, which are covered in the first two courses of the Statistics for Public Health specialisation. If you are unfamiliar with these skills, we suggest you review Statistical Thinking for Public Health and Linear Regression for Public Health before beginning this course. If you are already familiar with these skills, we are confident that you will enjoy furthering your knowledge and skills in Statistics for Public Health: Logistic Regression for Public Health.

The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.

The first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist “conquest” of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.

The third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as "superstition", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.

Over the past several decades, operations strategy has played an increasingly important role in business’ success. In this course, we will equip you with concepts and tools to build operations in a way that not only supports your competitive strategy, but also allows you to create new opportunities in the market place.

Scaling operations: Linking strategy and execution is a five-week course dedicated to making strategic decisions that are grounded in operational reality. Together, we will study how to build and evaluate the “operating system” of the firm to maximize value.

Are you looking to learn more about how to conduct scientific research, specifically in an urban or local context? Then you have found the right course: Studying Cities: Social Science Methods for Urban Research by the Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS), Erasmus University Rotterdam. During the course you will gain more insight in the different steps of the research cycle, and build a firm foundation for your own future research endeavors.

Before any (urban) researcher may start conducting research, it is crucial to understand the different aspects and elements of doing research. The course will guide you through the various steps of the research cycle to provide you with the basic knowledge necessary for any Master-level program, but with a special focus on urban and local development. The course starts with introductory lectures on the problem statement, research objective, empirical cycle and the research question. Over the following weeks you will also learn the components and criteria of the theoretical framework and operationalization, research strategies, and the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data. You will be provided with the necessary tools to understand and evaluate these key steps in scientific research by watching video lectures with in-video questions and by completing the final peer review, which will use all the elements you have learnt throughout the course.', '{"Managerial Accounting Fundamentals","Channel Management and Retailing ","Sales Pitch and Closing","Sample-based Learning Methods","Researcher Management and Leadership Training","Neural Networks and Deep Learning","Introduction to FPGA Design for Embedded Systems","Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow","Principal Component Analysis with NumPy"}', 'Transness', 1, 599, 26, 'http://www.outdoor-photos.com/_photo/2569091.jpg', '{"Middle teeth ladies unwonted","Leading abatement delicate consumed contribute hollow vengeful stepped unhinted rope furnishes credited","Churchyard whiteness prospects infancy yawingly bishop lifelike subdued","External smoke totally descendants influence blackened","Whizzings allegory congeal negative deserves voyage began experienced aloft"}', 'SCSSMfUR_l5', '{"Seating unflatter","Circumnavigating demonismjin","Fitness mounted profundities leaving","Commotion dreary pitches underwent","Ascertained invulnerable litter","Schooner unresting"}', '09:15:00-08', '21:30:00-08', '2049-01-09 04:54:08+00', '2049-11-07 15:13:23+00', 'de2fac4b-8d3e-41f4-979f-ab075aa6154f');

How do we decide when we’re moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you are—in your city, community, or neighborhood—and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.

Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plans—our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. 

This Teach-Out will ask the following questions:
•	What are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? 
•	How do people connect with places in our modern cities? 
•	Do places progress? 
•	How can we measure in them whether there is any “progress”? 

We will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.

A Teach-Out is: 
– an event – it takes place over a fixed, short period of time 
– an opportunity – it is open for free participation to everyone around the world 
– a community – it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals 
– a conversation – an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people 

This community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emory’s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. 

Originating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community.

It covers areas such as EV history, nomenclature, biogenesis, EV cargo as well as the release and uptake mechanisms, collection and processing prior to isolation, different isolation methods, characterization and quantification techniques.

This course is divided into five modules. Module 1 is an introduction to the field and will cover the nomenclature and the history of EVs.  Module 2 will focus on the biogenesis, release and uptake mechanisms of EVs as well as the different EV cargos (RNA, protein, lipids). In Module 3, we will focus on the collection and processing of cell culture media and body fluids such as blood, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid and urine prior to isolation of EVs. Module 4 and 5 will present different isolation methods and characterization/quantification techniques, respectively. Here differential ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, density gradient, kit based precipitation, electron microscopy (EM), cryo-TEM, flow cytometry, atomic-force microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis will be presented.  

The recommended prerequisites are college-freshman-level biology and biochemistry.
After a completed course you should be able to:
+ Discuss the nomenclature and subgroups of extracellular vesicles.
+ Describe the RNA, protein and lipid content of extracellular vesicles.
+ Describe the basic concepts about the most common isolation and characterization techniques and how these techniques are used in the EV field. 
+ State the benefits and limitations of the most common isolation and characterization techniques for extracellular vesicles. + Explain the considerations that are important during the collection and isolation of EVs from different body fluid.
+ Describe the release and uptake mechanisms of extracellular vesicles

All lectures are given in English.

-To introduce participants to different concepts of love, to empower them to be conscious of the power of love and the possibility of practicing it in everyday life, and to highlight in particular the idea of love as a force for social justice.

-To communicate a sense of personal strength and empowerment by actively learning from each other and beginning to define how participants can apply their learning in service to society.

This course will explore the concept of agape love (compassion/kindness) as a force for social justice and action and as the inspiration for service and the application of knowledge to positive social change. Biological, psychological, religious, and social perspectives of love will be discussed, drawing on the expertise of people from a variety of disciplines. 

During the six-week course, the following topics will be raised and discussed: kinds of love/defining love; non-violent communication; love and the biology of the brain; love as a basic concept of religious and ethical beliefs (e.g., Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Gandhian); love applied in action, and poetic expressions of love as a social force. This curriculum aims to foster a sense of the importance of love as a key phenomenon in creating community, connection, and functional societies among humans.

Course materials will draw from a variety of sources. One of the goals of the class is to provide participants with some knowledge of the literature of love, and readings for the course are listed in the outline of the course on the pages that follow.', '{"Advanced Linear Models for Data Science 1: Least Squares","计算机辅助翻译原理与实践 Principles and Practice of Computer-Aided Translation","Reliable Cloud Infrastructure: Design and Process em Português Brasileiro","Build Your Professional ePortfolio in English","Applied Machine Learning in Python","Organizational Behavior: How to Manage People","From Disease to Genes and Back"}', 'http://bead.example.com/', 10, 699, 16, 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7i3F7wk0OsjSlNGZ_-fqASD5avE=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/public/CIALEHBQZM56LOAE2SCUO2XENM.jpg', '{"Thunderbolts indolently pitched assertion various apparition","Aforethought ghastly comported create methodically surmises expandingly smothering murderous","Brigs obedience privileges morquan circumstanced ''gallantsails furious","Steed perquisites","Phan elements spreads august imputed eyeing ancient demonisms glittering americans scorched","Wormpipe sunglade bolstering perverse hairturbaned strip friar gamesomeness nations marrow openly","Forlorn iceberg seacaptain stantive fatality miguel splice bailiff breath verily","Ignoble tomorrow chemistry","Sitteth hebrews reaped seethingly wellknown","Aslant verdant proud amputations","Enemy resides marines hints unexampled flirted"}', 'LaaFfSJ_vq', '{"Somehow opening neatness extracted","Presenting department literally direful","Obscure counterpart","Butterfly storm figuera swerved","Tusked fatal constitution"}', '00:15:00-06', '13:30:00-06', '2029-03-06 01:38:18+00', '2047-10-26 14:05:54+00', '57952402-482a-48e4-be6e-5f27106ff46a');

Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.

ESSENTIALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F. SWENSEN FUND FOR INNOVATION IN TEACHING.

The Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health

For almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see: 

- Required readings
- Recommended readings
- Recommended videos

We have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.

For each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.

In addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session. 

The first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.

The second set of “recommended readings” is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.

Learners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.

We have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening.', '{"UX Design: From Concept to Prototype","علم النجاح: ما يجب أن تعرفه من الباحثين ","Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments","Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine: Foundations en Français","Building AI Applications with Watson APIs"}', 'http://example.net/bit?basketball=airplane', 9, 999, 1, 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7i3F7wk0OsjSlNGZ_-fqASD5avE=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/public/CIALEHBQZM56LOAE2SCUO2XENM.jpg', '{"Cleopatra denoted shadowed pedestals sinners sportively sundry befallen poised unsocial unless","Obedience danced leave among"}', 'EoGH_pG', '{"Forget gorge","Notice complimented saucers","Watching joyful mossy","Olassen quoted","Understood north","Pinetree greedy star"}', '08:15:00-08', '16:00:00-08', '2030-05-21 19:26:03+00', '2030-07-02 05:12:10+00', 'f64c42f5-c237-4857-aeed-fd9a3d3ac599');

This is the aim of the Circular Economy, but it doesn’t happen on its own. It is the result of choices and strategies by suppliers, designers, businesses, policymakers and all of us as consumers. 

In addition to providing many cases of managing materials for sustainability, the course also teaches skills and tools for analyzing circular business models and promotes development of your own ideas to become more involved in the transition to a Circular Economy.

You will learn from expert researchers and practitioners from around Europe as they explain core elements and challenges in the transition to a circular economy over the course of 5 modules:

Module 1: Materials. This module explores where materials come from, and builds a rationale for why society needs more circularity. 

Module 2: Circular Business Models. In this module circular business models are explored in-depth and a range of ways for business to create economic and social value are discussed.

Module 3: Circular Design, Innovation and Assessment. This module presents topics like functional materials and eco-design as well as methods to assess environmental impacts.

Module 4: Policies and Networks. This module explores the role of governments and networks and how policies and sharing best practices can enable the circular economy.

Module 5: Circular Societies. This module examines new norms, forms of engagement, social systems, and institutions, needed by the circular economy and how we, as individuals, can help society become more circular.

Its applications are ubiquitous throughout our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions on the use of scarce or expensive resources such as staffing and material resources also allow corporations to improve their profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.

This course is intended for students who have completed Advanced Modelling for Discrete Optimization.  In this course, you will extend your understanding of how to solve challenging discrete optimization problems by learning more about the solving technologies that are used to solve them, and how a high-level model (written in MiniZinc) is transformed into a form that is executable by these underlying solvers. By better understanding the actual solving technology, you will both improve your modeling capabilities, and be able to choose the most appropriate solving technology to use.

This course will cover advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.

In the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual''s genome differs from the "reference genome" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and "map" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.

In the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.

Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins.', '{}', 'Fauxville', 8, 499, 10, 'https://www.artinconnu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/monalisa.png', '{"Planting periodical johnson unensanguined forward vacancy denotes trees world public everyone","Customary cared moored disas fisheries","Menacing grapnels oldest while necessitated tinges corre place valparaiso doggedly strongly saint"}', 'FMiDaP(V_rd', '{"Allusions projecting rolls trophy","Execute breakfasting quitting plunging","Evening seized perishing"}', '01:00:00-06', '23:30:00-06', '2024-04-02 21:27:12+00', '2049-04-26 19:45:51+00', '9b9fd948-d0f3-4c69-8d20-d4a8f2c40b46');

Since this is a practical, project-based course, you will need to prior experience with Python programming, convolutional neural networks, and Keras with a TensorFlow backend.

Data augmentation is a technique used to create more examples, artiﬁcially, from an existing dataset. This is useful if your dataset is small and you want to increase the number of examples. Data augmentation can often solve over-fitting so that your model generalizes well after training. For images, a variety of augmentation can be applied to increase the number of examples.

Lund University

Lund University was founded in 1666 and has for a number of years been ranked among the world’s top 100 universities. The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia''s largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. 

The Faulty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.
The faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. 

The Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.
The MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

Within this course, you will get a historical overview of how sustainability has been understood, as well as a thorough introduction to the SDGs – what they are, how progress can be measured, and how the SDGs are relevant for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. The course will examine how various societal actors are responding to and implementing the SDGs. 

While all of the SDGs are essential to sustainable development, SDG 13, Climate Action, is usually perceived as the most urgent in terms of the need for a swift implementation on a global scale. Therefore, particular focus is given to this SDG. Through the course, you will gain up-to-date knowledge of the current understanding of human impacts on the Earth at the planetary level. Progress towards establishing global management of human interactions with the climate system within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is also discussed.

The course is designed and taught by Professor Katherine Richardson, who is a member of the 15-person panel appointed by the UN General Secretary in 2016 to write the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report.

We will explore what humanitarian interventions could look like if we want to mitigate the effects of disasters. The course content is a mix of theoretical knowledge and many practical examples from recent disasters. We think this course is unique because it contains so many practical ‘real-life’ examples and is taught by instructors and guest lecturers who together have over 200 years of experience in this field. 

The course consists of 10 modules totaling approximately 9-10 hours of delivered content with an additional 2-3 hours of self-work (quizzes and writing and evaluating a short peer-review assignment) as well as lively discussions forums. The course has been designed in a way that each module builds on the lessons of previous modules. However, you may do the modules in any order and some can be done separately. 

You do not have to pay for this course if you choose to enroll without a certificate. Sometimes referred to as auditing, enrolling without a certificate means that you will have access to all of the videos, quizzes, assignments, and discussions. The only difference is that you will not receive a certificate upon completion. Click the Enroll Without a Certificate link to sign up and begin the course. Even if you enroll in a session that has yet to begin, you may access most of the course materials right away by clicking the Preview Course Materials link. However, you will have to wait for the session to begin before posting your comments on the discussion forum or accessing the final peer-reviewed assessment.

Мы хотим предложить вам небольшой курс, назвать который можно было  и так, как он озаглавлен на нашем сайте «История международных отношений».  А можно было бы  по-другому – «Введение в историю современных международных отношений». Дело в том, что в пределах отведенного нам времени невозможно проследить и уж тем более изучить, понять процесс  становления того, что мы называем современные международные отношения. Но вполне можно попытаться  обнаружить  наиболее важные, «долгоиграющие» события, мысли, их авторов, сформировавших сегодняшний мир – сложный и противоречивый. 
Мы постараемся обойтись без упоминания и критики различных «историзмов», оставив это занятие исследователям теории международных отношений. Нас будет главным образом интересовать фактология, распределение по хронологической шкале хорошо известных и неоправданно забытых событий мировой истории. 
Мир с конца ХIХ века, а это – начало нашего курса,  стремительно изменялся. Достаточно вспомнить, что итоги Первой мировой войны подводили 27 государств, преимущественно – монархии. Подписи под учредительными документами ООН по итогам Второй мировой войны поставили 51 страна, а сегодня  международное сообщество насчитывает более 200 стран, из них только 19 монархий.
 Мы постараемся понять – какую роль в развитии системы международных отношений играл научно-технический прогресс, почему  для большинства участников международных отношений во второй половине ХХ столетия  Холодная война имела первостепенное значение, какое воздействие и почему оказала  на развитие международных связей деколонизация. 
Международная арена, которую вполне оправданно сравнивают с большой шахматной доской, имела в разные времена разные правила игры и очень сложный состав участников. Вряд ли мы успеем и сумеем изучить все правила, но понять мотивы игроков, их цели постараемся. Вслед за Марком Твеном мы вполне можем заявить: «Прежде всего нужны факты, а уж потом их можно перевирать.»', '{"Decision-Making and Scenarios","A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment"}', 'South Backville', 0, 0, 32, 'https://facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Van-Gogh-Starry-Night.jpg', '{"Charger words these animosity contentedly other entrenched"}', 'Имо_eV', '{"Ports chrysalis postcaptain","Suspect guided reminded","Starlight represent willingly turning","Fowls begins gaining magnetic","Padlock tying stances profound"}', '02:15:00-07', '14:15:00-07', '2024-04-29 23:08:53+00', '2041-03-24 11:13:47+00', '81eceb6e-081a-4e73-923a-27114256657c');

What used to be an experimental, risky, and very limited treatment option more than 50 years ago is now routinely performed in many countries worldwide. The number of renal transplants is expected to rise sharply in the next decade since the proportion of patients with end stage renal disease is increasing. 

Are you interested in clinical kidney, pancreas and islet transplantation? If you are a (bio) medical student or a health care professional who works in the (pre) clinical transplant field this might be the course for you. This course is also for anyone interested in the research and knowledge on clinical transplantation. The course will be taught by a multidisciplinary team of transplant professionals and will give you the state of the art updates. 

It is divided in 4 modules: 
1) Before the transplant 
2) The surgical procedures and the challenged patient, including the patient with diabetes 
3) Early challenges 
4) Late challenges after transplantation. 

The offered modules will include lectures, interactive patient cases, 3D movies, interviews with well-known experts and with patients and a donor, a serious game to increase knowledge of the field and of course an active forum. Become an expert and join us!

The course is endorsed by The European Society of Organ Transplantation (ESOT), The International Society of Nephrology (ISN) and The Transplantation Society (TTS).

This MOOC has been accredited for Continuing Medical Education (CME). Health care professionals who works in the (pre) clinical transplant field, other health care professionals and general practitioners can obtain CME credit at ''LUMC-Boerhaave CME'' upon passing the course. For more information we like to refer to the "Additional introduction for obtaining CME credit" module in week 1 of the course

In addition, you will explore how to implement each data structure using industry-standard Java practices, and gain experience manipulating real life data sets.

Data structures are an essential tool for any developer, and allow us to store and efficiently access data for even large datasets. Mastery of data structures allows your programs to be scalable and function without taking up too many system resources. We will use the Java Collections versions of each of these data structures, just as you would in real-life. Students can expect to walk away from the course confident in their ability to manipulate essential Java data structures, and have a working knowledge theory behind each data structure.

Knowing where things are is effortless.  But “under the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.

The material in this course is based on a book I''ve written for a general audience.  The book is called "Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. 

The course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.

Jennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain''s spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled "Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).

Much of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).

Dr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.

Dr. Groh’s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

If you’ve ever had the dream, the desire or even just a vague notion that you would like to write a novel, this course is for you. Whether you are a full-time student, have a full-time job, a family to take care of or all of the above, you can do it. Really! And I will help you get there.

In this Course, you will write your first novel. Many people say they have often thought about writing a novel and are planning to do it someday, but very few ever actually do. However, in this course, you will do it. You will learn how to form a basic idea, any idea, into a structure and discipline that will allow you to create, write and complete a fully-realized novel ready to submit for publication.

As part of my Transmedia Writing course, learners write the first two chapters of a novel. Learner Review from Transmedia Writing: 
“I was toying with this idea of writing a book then I found this course Transmedia Writing through Coursera. This course really pushed me to my limits and it is an eye opener for me that there are goals that I can still achieve and accomplish through the world of writing. It was a challenging, very thorough and very detailed course but completing it was a very rewarding experience. This course really exceeded my expectations.”

In Write Your First Novel, you’ll learn to break down your creative endeavor into components and you’ll discover a process that will allow you to do what few have done: produce and complete a full-length work of fiction in the form of a 50,000-word novel. 

I am a proponent of experiential learning (also known as active learning). My lectures are short and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a writer. I will guide you, I will show you how to get there, hopefully I will inspire you. You will learn through your own activity - which is writing! I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write! 
 
Learner Review from Transmedia Writing:
 “I completed your Transmedia Writing course and I wanted to thank you for your encouragement throughout the course… you told us to keep writing diligently and finish our novel. Well… I finally finished writing all 20 chapters of my book!”

Writing fiction is a truly beautiful thing. Putting your own words on a page to tell a story which enters your readers minds and allows them to share the thoughts, emotions and lives of your characters is a very satisfying, rewarding experience.', '{}', 'https://example.com/bell.html', 0, 399, 22, 'https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/david-irvine-cover.jpg', '{"Expression distantly divine afforded anxiety cruisinggrounds level dismal","Lucky burning beheld intent levanter mills learnedly casualties bookbinder anxious","Burnish measures emblem threads harmless corporeal agonising","Germain aspects wildocean north cling hintings","Fidently mount quick pitted probability howling perilousness glide","Danger mower fifty","Pictures tigeryellow service regal invariability cour medi specimen","Narrated incontestable freely specialities bubbles choose","Necks becalmed sighed easily committing circumstanced milestones alongside","Priests proverb","Consequences vishnu implicated periodically shared humanity surges breaches completely","Sinners vacancy","Bearing oaken mechanical","Coloured natural crying meanest rending instinctively obeying gasps delight crunched clanged","Count adios openly technical"}', 'WYFN_Nf', '{"Meadows halfmelted","Playing schoolboys pata"}', '09:30:00-07', '20:15:00-07', '2024-04-12 18:41:55+00', '2038-05-17 05:53:24+00', '363c3334-dd2e-44eb-af09-6736a617d942');

Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining and learning analytics systems in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ‘big data’ including data persistency and student profiling.

Il en présente les sources, les catégories, le contenu et les limites qui leur sont opposables, ainsi que les obligations qu’ils génèrent à la charge des Etats. Il expose aussi les principaux mécanismes de mise en œuvre prévus au niveau universel et régional pour assurer leur respect. 

Depuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les droits de l’homme sont un domaine en plein essor. De nombreuses causes sont aujourd’hui défendues et débattues sous la bannière des droits de l’homme : la protection des minorités, la lutte contre la discrimination des femmes, des personnes lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles et transgenres (LGBT), la lutte contre la torture et les disparitions forcées, la lutte contre la pauvreté ou encore la protection de l’environnement et la protection des données. Partout dans le monde, ces causes mobilisent tant les acteurs politiques que la société civile et elles sont discutées dans de multiples enceintes, nationales et internationales.

Le présent cours vise à offrir les bases nécessaires pour appréhender et comprendre le domaine vaste et complexe que sont devenus les droits de l’homme. Quelles sont les caractéristiques et les différentes catégorie des droits de l’homme ? Quels sont leurs fondements philosophiques et historiques ? Pourquoi ces droits sont-ils importants ? Quels instruments visent à les protéger ? Comment rendre ces droits opérationnels ? Quels mécanismes existent pour les mettre en œuvre et quels sont leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients ?

En abordant ces questions, le cours s’adresse tant à des membres de la communauté universitaire qu’à des praticiens (responsables politiques, membres du corps diplomatique, fonctionnaires, journalistes, membres d’ONG, défenseurs des droits de l’homme et spécialistes de la coopération au développement, de l’aide humanitaire et des questions relatives aux réfugiés), ainsi qu’à toutes les personnes qui sont engagées dans la protection des droits de l’homme ou simplement désireuses de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.

Le cours est conçu et dispensé par les Professeurs Maya Hertig Randall et Michel Hottelier, de la Faculté de droit de l’Université de Genève. Durant le cours, des membres d’organes et institutions voués à la protection des droits de l’homme et des spécialistes de la communauté académique seront invités à intervenir.

Le cours est donné en français. Il consiste en une série de 8 sessions, comprenant chacune un certain nombre de brèves présentations vidéo (8 à 15 minutes). Chaque session s''accompagne d''un questionnaire d''évaluation.

The Bible refers to its gods, rulers, and pyramids. Neighboring cultures in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean wrote about its god-like kings and its seemingly endless supply of gold.  The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt''s culture and history.

As the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt''s hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in the world''s first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has kept interest alive.

Join Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders of this ancient land.  He has developed this online course and set it in the galleries of the world famous Penn Museum.

Learners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as “sister arts” but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose.

This course is built on the notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.

Though any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). 

We''ll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts.

On the basis of selected cases, and through interviews with judges and lawyers, you will explore the role of these courts and tribunals and their potential to contribute to global justice. 

The first module of the course will investigate how judicial settlement is different from other more political forms of dispute settlement, such as negotiation and mediation. It offers a brief historical overview and introduces the judicial and arbitral bodies based in The Hague. In the remaining modules you will learn about the functions of these courts and tribunals, and some of the challenges and prospects that they face. Three cross-cutting themes tie together all of these modules: (i) The interaction between law and politics; (ii) The continuing role of State consent; and (iii) The ability of international courts and tribunals to protect the public interest and global values.

This course offers you an opportunity to gain a better insight into the functions and features of the courts and tribunals present in The Hague. You will gain a familiarity with each court or tribunal. You will develop realistic expectations of their capacity to address contemporary problems and an awareness of their limitations. You will also be able to discuss some of their most prominent cases. 

If you would like to have a better understanding of international law in action in The Hague, this is definitely the course for you!

A range of academic climate change experts and professional leaders are featured.

As a result of completing this course, you will be able to:

1) Identify individual, community, and political actions you can engage in to effectively address and respond to climate change.

2) Describe how insights from the social sciences can be employed to create change at the individual, community, and political levels.

3) Feel empowered to continue to influence how you, your community, and political leaders address and respond to climate change.

Due to this cause or another, it’s a huge stress to look at most Powerpoint slides. Depending on the “design” skills of the speaker and audience’s taste slides create different emotions from a slight annoyance to physical sickness.

But that is not the worst thing. The worst thing is that instead of improving the presentation such slides confuse the audience, distract it and finally oblige the speaker to explain them rather than being quite self-explanatory.

The goal of this course is to change that by equipping learners with a set of tools to create simple, clear and aesthetic slides which improve the presentation of the speaker. The course covers universal design principles, templates, colors, typefaces, slides’ typography, use of photos and pictograms, composition rules and ways to create clear and meaningful charts and diagrams.

This course is not a PowerPoint fundamentals course. You should have a basic knowledge of either Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote software.

Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.

Part 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’. 

Part 2 (this course) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.

Introducción al análisis de políticas públicas', '¿Qué son las políticas públicas? Son la plasmación más concreta de la política. Lo que los gobiernos hacen, y dejan de hacer, para hacer frente a los problemas colectivos. Este curso trata sobre cómo se decide qué problemas abordar y qué soluciones adoptar. Un proceso primordialmente político y social que suele escapar al análisis puramente racional.

A lo largo del curso analizaremos por qué algunos problemas adquieren la categoría de problemas públicos mientras que otros no llegan a captar la atención, describiremos la pugna política que suele haber tras la descripción e interpretación de los problemas, identificaremos el complejo entramado de actores dispuestos a influir en la adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo las discrepancias se suelen extender más allá de la toma de decisiones y hasta la aplicación práctica de la política pública. Trataremos también sobre las grandes dificultades que padecen gobiernos y actores sociales para llegar a saber si las políticas que se llevan a cabo son realmente útiles y cómo aprender a mejorar su rendimiento.

 Los objetivos de este curso son:
1.	Mostrar a los alumnos un número de casos reales que ilustran la complejidad de los procesos de adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo estos procesos pueden ser incoherentes con los modelos racionales de toma de decisiones.
2.	Transmitir a los alumnos los fundamentos e instrumental del análisis de políticas públicas para que puedan afrontar creativamente problemas del mundo real.
3.	Contribuir a que los alumnos sean ciudadanos conocedores del funcionamiento de los sistemas democráticos.


Por ello, el curso se dirige a todas las personas interesadas en los problemas colectivos, así como a aquellas que quieran convertirse en participantes influyentes en el proceso de formación de las políticas, ya sea como analistas, funcionarios públicos, trabajadores del tercer sector, o como ciudadanos comprometidos en causas políticas. También se dirige a estudiantes que se dispongan a iniciar estudios de grado o postgrado en administración pública, gestión pública o análisis de políticas públicas.', '{"Introducción al mundo de las negociaciones","Introducción a la programación con Python","Parallel Programming in Java","Building Resilient Streaming Systems on Google Cloud Platform auf Deutsch","Visualizing Citibike Trips with Tableau","Legal Tech & Startups ","Tinkering Fundamentals: Motion and Mechanisms"}', 'https://www.example.edu/boy.php', 10, 1200, 14, 'http://www.outdoor-photos.com/_photo/2569091.jpg', '{"Tomorrow mincingknives knifelike permanent entirely","Beaters brides ungrateful musically","Maintained purposely caramba bluffchested allowing motionless marius outstretched applies however middle","Peculiarities crippled again iroquois great carve fashions copius","Fearfully sweating shipmate quiver allseeing blade shared herent","Charts thumbworn revived deliberate creamcolour aimed","Miasmas century alleghanies possessed pizarro adventures criticism","Venetian grand yards morbid audacious rowing omitted tables","Conversation prints taking connection increasing showers nished setting proper","Perseverance provoked others thread locality burst","Unless spies","Walks companions shape owing thwack rapidly sleet","Thanked instead known beggar evangelical honourable prevent pooneer alternating crests wrenched","Forehatchway ''corrupt unnear clouds resuming","Plughole aslant connect wrenched eellike require serious"}', 'DydpIaadpp_KH', '{"Paint impartial extraordinary beasts","Greedy periodically","Contrast ambition panic picked","Managing sleeping exasperations","Pretty addressed","Advanced shook whalingcaptains","Steadying whereupon determinate","Coupled occasionally pected"}', '09:30:00-07', '22:45:00-07', '2024-10-15 14:21:59+00', '2045-04-30 14:03:26+00', '5a0119eb-6833-494e-beef-43c3b21893bb');

The structure of the course is intentionally wide and shallow: We will cover many topics, but will not go extremely deep into any one topic area, thereby providing a broad overview of the immense landscape of IIoT. There is one exception: We will study security in some depth as this is the most important topic for all "Internet of Things" product development.

In this course students will learn :
  * What Industry 4.0 is and what factors have enabled the IIoT
  * Key skills to develop to be employed in the IIoT space
  * What platforms are, and also market information on Software and Services
  * What the top application areas are (examples include manufacturing and oil & gas)
  * What the top operating systems are that are used in IIoT deployments
  * About networking and wireless communication protocols used in IIoT deployments
  * About computer security; encryption techniques and secure methods for insuring data integrity and authentication', '{"Supply Chain Analytics Essentials","Introducción a Java","Introduction to numerical analysis","Applications of Everyday Leadership","Create Online Employee Onboarding Course with Eduflow","Mathematical Foundations for Cryptography"}', 'Strongburgh Hills', 7, 799, 30, 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7i3F7wk0OsjSlNGZ_-fqASD5avE=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/public/CIALEHBQZM56LOAE2SCUO2XENM.jpg', '{"Crabs highruffed forthwith seacandies delirious stirs criticism errant steersman continent","Fencer hills executed","Advancing reliably always images reaping spirally grinning driven breaks tutored rearing pirate","Onset scythes snowwhite perseverance promises knives suburban","Shocks grand among abandon milkwhite mirth please roots famous","Priest underlings communicated declaring fidently simoom palsied stirs inspection heated stretch","Shipwrecks hairturbaned suddenly","Thunder stately fancied","Forecastle appearances resided telltale dogged introduced festival","Narwhales ignorantly prairie adhering attained sight library freight sheets respective gayheader sheaf","Securing although completion crucified caesarian sanity tinges","Correct distrusting pensable portions contradictory alto believe sheetiron ignoble madness","Series second future traitors easily","Yarns jollies sheep aboriginally microscopic scientific armies heated sufferings barbary"}', 'IIMaS_is', '{"Eastward respect","Maledictions speaks earth flinging","Frock pacing swelling reliably","Smiled destruction thing","Precincts awhaling","Shaft unknown entombment","Articulated marvels theology","Allengrossing paint antarctic"}', '10:45:00-06', '18:15:00-06', '2042-04-16 17:32:07+00', '2049-07-30 11:30:51+00', '0c73e7f8-4129-4bcf-923a-5b961484724d');

Like other kinds of design, fashion thrives on productive tensions between form and function, automation and craftsmanship, standardization and customization, universality and self-expression, and pragmatism and utopian vision. It exists in the service of others, and it can have profound consequences—social, political, cultural, economic, and environmental.

Fashion as Design focuses on a selection of more than 70 garments and accessories from around the world, ranging from kente cloth to jeans to 3D-printed dresses. Through these garments, we’re going to look closely at what we wear, why we wear it, how it’s made, and what it means. You’ll hear directly from a range of designers, makers, historians, and others working with clothing every day—and, in some cases, reinventing it for the future. Studio visits, interviews, and other resources introduce the history and development of each garment and their changing uses, meanings, and impact over time. 

Course Learning Objectives:

Develop critical tools to appreciate and contextualize fashion design—from everyday clothing to couture garments—through many different perspectives. 

Trace the history, development, and impact of garments over time, and explore how they may be reinvented.

Investigate garments through multiple lenses including politics, identity, and economics. 

Understand more about the lifecycle of clothing, from its design and production to its marketing, distribution, and consumption. 

Better comprehend the choices you make about fashion with respect to the visual language of dress, individual and collective identities, and issues such as labor practices, sustainability, and body politics.', '{}', 'Farmside', 9, 399, 18, 'https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/92/b0/8292b087090a311714e62de321694ef7.jpg', '{"Eaves feeling","Pockets shiftings adventurously facetiousness pervading picked terrors","Harpooneer cried survived anguish","Captain capitals unreasonably asleep anybody committing dangerous generous highland","Cruise squint magnetic below eternal","Golden innocence unstarched knobby unthinking","Wandering quiet townho shapes contains pedro heated stooping","Secrets vapoured rafts roared mobydick spontaneously tables rediscovery","Encamp heated connect heard discover invariability spangling tinual gunwale palmed prairies pondering","Subsiding bareheaded leviathans exciting cuttlefish fathomdeep prepara breast hissing inference","Weltering forced conceit prying stantive tender collapsed conventional","Regions music exact unerring sleeves composing research count freebooting","Command mount","Beach secrets steering waist reeving narrowly trifles dripping","Stampings mouths","Heartless after despairing insane endless other companions worth persuasions"}', 'FaD_pJ', '{"Dotted sprang draft neighbouring","Beard interesting gallant magnificent","Miscellaneous regular stumpspeech summoned"}', '10:30:00-06', '20:00:00-06', '2044-02-27 23:40:40+00', '2048-03-28 05:54:03+00', '18bcb731-a337-44f9-94b9-4d0a4966ef8a');

Many of entrepreneurship opportunities in emerging markets arise out of necessity, or the drive to solve a real need or a social problem. Thus emerging markets often offer huge opportunities for disruptive innovation. Entrepreneurship has contributed to economic growth and been able to respond to social problems, helping some communities prosper. With the rise of fintech, financial solutions using technologies such as the cloud, blockchain and machine learning have by-passed or partnered with established financial institutions to serve new markets. 

This course takes us through the basics from “What is entrepreneurship?” to applying commonly used business planning tools, such as design thinking and business model canvas. Design thinking is a methodology that encourages startups to focus on user-centric products and services. There are also insights on topics like regulation, intellectual property, funding and growth that are important for startups.

I’ve invited along experts who teach and support entrepreneurs. This includes some really interesting people in various stages of their start-up business development. We will be talking with Zlto (a digital currency), Yoco (mobile payments), Proof of Steak (alternative asset investment) and Kuba (a digital ‘middleman’ for small businesses) to name a few.

1. Conocer la constitución de la materia viva;
2. Estudiar la organización de los distintos seres vivos;
3. Estudiar las funciones que éstos realizan.

The course participants are introduced to the multi-faceted field of the treatment of trauma patients. Different trauma mechanism and their sequelae are elucidated, as well as the respective gold standard of medical treatment of these injuries by means of modern trauma surgery. All episodes – of which each one is dedicated to a distinct pathology – follow the same approach:
•	Introduction and/or repetition of the anatomic principles
•	Prelude of the topic by means of a film
•	Classification of the treated wound, e.g. according to AO
•	Summary of relevant and current therapeutic options
•	Each episode is interspersed with short quizzes to immediately recapitulate the learned contents and which will help solving the exam quizzes

This course brings together two key subjects, International Marketing and Cross Industry Innovation. It will provide the basic foundations of international marketing and then explain how companies can grow by going abroad or sourcing ideas/expanding into other countries or industries. This is summarized as CCCI: Cross-Country and Cross-Industry Innovation, a term and analytical platform used throughout not only this course but others in the specialization. As an introductory course, we keep the concepts short and simple in order to ease learners into the wonderful world of international marketing. More specific operational aspects such as managing the product, price, place and promotion as well as targeting and positioning will be provided in the second course of the specialization. 

After you successfully complete this course learners will obtain the following outcomes:

(1) an understanding of the core meaning of marketing and international marketing. 
(2) learn that international marketing is about striking the right balance between maximizing the similarities across cultures (Etic approach) and customizing marketing (Emic approach) to important local differences.
(3) learn about how to source or expand into other industries at home or abroad via cross industry innovation.
(4) obtain a solid foundation for subsequent courses such as course 2 (International Marketing Entry and Execution) and the industry-specific courses in the specialization.', '{"Создание Web-сервисов на Python	","The Fundamentals of Revenue Management: The Cornerstone of Revenue Strategy","(Business Writing) الكتابة في مجال الأعمال","Predictive Modeling and Analytics ","Improve Business Performance with Google Forms",中级商务汉语（入职与营销篇）,"Journalism, the future, and you!","Controle Usando a Resposta em Frequência","Inclusión social de personas con discapacidad desde un enfoque de derechos."}', 'Fortworth', 3, 399, 6, 'https://facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Van-Gogh-Starry-Night.jpg', '{"Outlaws reeving prove observed","Children ropes bring particulars others loaded mastership wedded pitched phenomenon","Pensable stowing","Assailants slave might oldfashioned pedro clenching established sculptures prudential robes","Bottling corpse string ridges shivering their unknown intensely improve","Loose exceed loomed province","Incredulous pulsively limbs frosts injury panting ideality decency","Takes picturesque corporal nobler voyager tropics glory greenland","Throbbing kedger certainly"}', 'ItIM_OA', '{"Overscorning manufactured prodromus universally","Heaved begins","Fleets united coupled","Example fathomdeep christenings","Plish rafts above"}', '08:45:00-06', '13:15:00-06', '2048-04-15 00:58:48+00', '2049-03-07 08:08:02+00', 'cd1aff5e-15be-4e0e-84d0-da3928a55299');

Dans les médias, la philanthropie est incarnée aujourd’hui par les milliardaires américains Bill Gates et Warren Buffet qui ont donné une grande part de leur fortune à une fondation en faveur de la santé et de l’éducation. Mais cette vision est partielle : la philanthropie est très active dans la plupart des régions du monde, pas seulement aux Etats-Unis, et ce ne sont pas seulement les très riches qui donnent, puisque de nombreux particuliers et entreprises s’impliquent. 

En ce début de XXIe siècle marqué par les crises économiques et politiques, la philanthropie joue un rôle croissant pour répondre aux grands défis de notre temps. Alternative au modèle marchand et à la redistribution publique via l’impôt, le don privé est activement recherché pour financer la lutte contre la pauvreté, l’éducation, la recherche médicale ou la culture… Partout dans le monde, les fondations se multiplient, les dons se développent et influencent la vie de très nombreuses personnes. Les besoins sont immenses et la concurrence pour trouver des fonds n’a jamais été aussi vive. 

Malgré son importance, la philanthropie reste mal connue notamment en France et en Europe. Plusieurs questions clés restent en suspens : De quoi parle-t-on exactement ? Qu’est-ce qui motive les philanthropes et favorise leur action ? Quelles sont les différentes façons d’agir en philanthropie ? Quel est son impact et comment l’évaluer? L’objectif de ce MOOC est de répondre à ces quatre grandes questions, en mobilisant les dernières avancées en matière de recherche et le point de vue d’experts reconnus dans leur domaine. 

Que vous soyez simplement curieux de découvrir le sujet, déjà donateur ou engagé dans une démarche philanthropique, ou un professionnel qui accompagne ou sollicite des philanthropes, ce MOOC est fait pour vous ! Chaque semaine, vous progresserez grâce à des vidéos alliant théorie et pratique, des lectures pour aller plus loin, des quiz pour renforcer vos acquis et des forums où vous pourrez échanger entre participants et avec l’équipe pédagogique. A l’issue de ce MOOC, vous aurez toutes les clés en main pour comprendre et agir en faveur d’un monde meilleur !

You''ll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. 

Whether you''re a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. 

As health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization''s current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. 

By the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ', '{"Elastic Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation em Português Brasileiro","Web Design: Wireframes to Prototypes","Practical Introduction to the Command Line","Diseñando páginas web con Bootstrap 4","Mastering Statics","Programación y presupuesto del proyecto","Information Visualization: Advanced Techniques","Переходные процессы в электрических цепях","L''impact investing : être acteur","Reproducible Templates for Analysis and Dissemination ","Myocardial Infarction"}', 'Cloudburgh Falls', 1, 699, 4, 'https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/david-irvine-cover.jpg', '{"Sweet tinges observed piazza benefit hapless travellers","Freed thickgilt allusions mackinaw eternity concern ashore complete nevertheless merry consideration","Attack foundation sculptures skeleton failures alone","Allusion breadth spray humps","Proving tearless incredulity","Compilations seventyfour contentedly panting exaggerate collision hopeless killing nurtured agencies carrion naked","Daring however ascrip victories mantle stowaways horrors veriest rally restores vicinities","Immortal whenever limitless remains using egyptian"}', 'LCiHI_Bx', '{"Cruise among","Sixtyfive hereditary"}', '01:15:00-05', '18:45:00-05', '2029-01-08 05:18:28+00', '2034-01-17 05:21:15+00', '5b85d445-00ba-4873-a7df-2c340472aa33');

By the end of the course the students should know the basic principles of lexical organization, the main parameters of semantic variations in lexicon, and be able to apply the basic methods of the analysis of lexical meaning to different lexical domains.
The course is designed for students of linguistic programs (BA, MA, PhD), as well as for teachers and researchers in the named field. 

The course contains the overview of different approaches to the semantic description of lexical items and lexical systems in different languages and discusses the methodology of Moscow Lexical Typology Group (lecture 1). This methodology (“frame approach”) is illustrated with the data of the following domains: aquamotion verbs (lecture 2), verbs of falling (lecture 3), adjectives denoting oldness (lecture  4) and pain metaphors (lecture 5 and 6). The results of the analyses are visualized with specially constructed lexical semantic maps.

Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors, optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations (e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability).

Why take this course?

•	It is important for you to be aware of the theoretical foundations of concurrency to avoid common but subtle programming errors. 
•	Java 8 has modernized many of the concurrency constructs since the early days of threads and locks.
•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on the forums.
•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

•	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
•	Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
•	Atomic variables and isolation
•	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
•	Actor model in Java

Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of concurrent Java programs, and will also help you master other concurrent programming system that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., POSIX threads, .NET threads).', '{"Data Analysis with Python","Autodesk Certified Professional: Revit for Architectural Design Exam Prep","Психология карьеры","Camino a la Excelencia en Gestión de Proyectos","Web Design for Everybody Capstone","Linux for Developers","Corporate Financial Decision-Making for Value Creation","Machine Learning: Regression","Зарисовки о Сибири.

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.

El Programa especializado en “Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo XXI”, es el primer programa especializado en línea, abierto y masivo que se produce desde el Centro de Liderazgo Público (CLP) de la Escuela de Gobierno Alberto Lleras Camargo de la Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. El CLP tiene como misión crear conocimiento y capacidad de liderazgo para ayudar a que progresemos en los temas complejos que más nos importan en el mundo actual. 

El programa fue diseñado por Maite Careaga Tagüeña, PhD y Héctor Fabio Hernández, MPP, con el apoyo de Saluma Castillo y el equipo Conecta-TE de la Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, y está inspirado en los cursos y talleres  de liderazgo que Maite lleva 15 años diseñando y facilitando  (los primeros los diseñó junto con Felipe Bozzo y Sebastián Quirmbach en Leaderbuilding) y en las lecciones aprendidas  al investigar cómo diseñar y evaluar estrategias pedagógicas para enseñar habilidades personales y sociales para el liderazgo.

Este curso ha sido diseñado como el cuarto y último del programa especializado (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/liderazgo), el cual te permitirá adueñarte de una metodología de intervención, que llamamos espiral de liderazgo consciente, y desarrollar y aplicar una caja de herramientas para movilizar personas (a sí mismo y a otros) a trabajar en solucionar los desafíos complejos que las afectan e importan. Los otros tres cursos del programa son: "Estilos de Liderazgo: opciones para avanzar en desafíos complejos", "Autoliderazgo y Gestión de Emociones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos" y "Comunicación, Experimentación y Aprendizaje en Liderazgo". Puedes tomar todos los cursos por separado o sólo uno de ellos, sin embargo te recomendamos que te inscribas y participes en los cuatro, ojalá en el orden que te proponemos.', '{"Music Business Foundations","Managing Your Money: MBA Insights for Undergraduates","Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code","HI-FIVE: Health Informatics For Innovation, Value & Enrichment (Clinical Perspective)","America''s Unwritten Constitution","Russian company law.

I''m excited to have you in the class and look forward to your contributions to the other learners in our community.

This free course will provide the knowledge and  the tools needed to understand what cities do, why they matter, the forces shaping the greatest wave of urbanization in history, and how to pick the right place for you. The course will also help you develop critical thinking skills. We''ll accomplish this by providing evidence of the importance of cities, and why and how they matter to you. Then we’ll ask you to apply what you’ve learned in an exercise which will help you assess your own community and find your best place.

 This course is accessible and open to anyone who is interested in learning more about cities and the ways they affect our lives. It is organized around five key modules: (1) Why Cities Matter,  (2) A World of Cities,  (3) The Creative City, (4) The Divided City and the New Urban Crisis, and (5) How to Find the Best Place for You.

 After completing the course, you will be able to:


(1) Identify why cities are the drivers of economic prosperity;
(2) Explain the drivers and implications of fast-growing urbanization worldwide;
(3) Outline the key characteristics of a creative and innovative city;
(4) Describe the social divides and challenges facing cities and the solutions cities are using to address them; and
(5) Recognize the trade-offs of staying in your current city versus moving, and identify the best place for you and your family to live.

We are convinced that the three Roosevelts – the 3Rs, as we will refer to them throughout this course – profoundly shaped the twentieth century. This course shows you why we think so and which paradigms, ideas, and sources we use to uphold our claim. But this course also asks you to give your opinion, and ground it on your own research findings. 

The structure of the course is straightforward: 
- An introductory module gives you the biographical information you need to connect the personal stories of the 3Rs with the major events of the twentieth century;
-  Module 2 explains how the 3Rs reframed our thinking on security, broadening its meaning and reconfiguring the government’s role in providing it; 
- Module 3, focusing on equality, shows how the 3Rs changed the relationship between leaders and led, rejected laissez-faire economics, and supported a politics of intervention to overcome the inequalities that undermined social cohesion;
- Module 4 describes how the 3Rs promoted and protected the freedom of ordinary citizens, and communicated that as one of their central political goals;
- Module 5 summarizes the long-lasting legacies of the 3Rs, and asks for your opinion on the Rooseveltian century. Do you agree with this interpretation of our recent past – and our possible futures?

The five modules contain quizzes to test your knowledge and understanding, discussion prompts to stimulate your creativity, and research guidance and assignments to sharpen up your historical skills.

Ce cours présente les principaux courants qui marquent aujourd''hui la réflexion éthique et touchent tout un chacun dans sa vie personnelle, sociale et citoyenne. D’Aristote à Kant, de Bentham à Derrida, à travers un voyage philosophique passionnant nous entrerons dans le vif du débat éthique contemporain.

Notre monde toujours plus complexe semble nous échapper. Réchauffement climatique, questions de début et de fin de vie, évolution vertigineuse des bio-technologies, inégale distribution des richesses, pressions migratoires accentuées… La tentation est grande d’une vie morale repliée sur elle-même à partir d’une éthique minimale : « fais ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en péril la liberté des autres ». Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied : défendre l’idée d’une éthique qui nous plonge dans notre réalité sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout réinventer.
C’est pourquoi nous présentons un cours qui permet de se familiariser avec les plus importantes perspectives éthiques traversant le monde contemporain : l’éthique des vertus (ou perfectionnisme) ; l’éthique du devoir (ou déontologisme) ; l’éthique utilitariste (ou conséquentialisme) ; l’éthique de l’amour (ou éthique du don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l’ordre dans ses idées, repérer les différentes manières de s’orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les différences d’appréciation face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.

Quels que soient votre champ de savoir académique, votre engagement professionnel ou vos choix personnels, il s’agit de proposer des clés d’analyse dont vous disposerez. Pour cela, nous alternerons tout au long de ce cours les présentations des grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but : clarifier les idées pour mieux comprendre le réel et mieux orienter l’action.

About this course:

This course presents the main schools of thought that frame today’s ethical reflection and affect everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant, from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: "do what you want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others". We propose to go against this trend and to defend the idea of ​​an ethics that immerses us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives. Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis. Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in order to better understand reality and orient human action.

And this approach contributes to integrating the sales planning process into the corporate strategy of the company because, in the strategy analysis and formulation process, we apply models, frameworks, tools, and techniques that also apply to the sales planning and management process. 
Therefore, the expected outcomes of this course focus on the transition from traditional to strategic sales planning, by discussing and applying the concepts recommended to support the development of the strategic guidelines. 
The concepts, models, tools, and techniques discussed and practiced during the course focus on the improvement of value creation from the sales function empowered by intelligence analysis, a process which typically applies in the strategy analysis front. 
The discussions go through how intelligence analysis can support the sales function, by providing methods to connect strategy to marketing and sales planning processes. 
In this course, the primary learning outcome is the ability to apply intelligence analysis to support sales planning process, and by being able to do this, you’ll improve your competencies and skills to support sales planning with a strategic approach. 
You’ll develop a final assignment at the end of the course, and it is designed from an adapted real-life business case. The challenges of the case comprise the business context, through which you’ll apply the conceptual framework discussed during Course 2.

Some of us like to count, others hate it, but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things, pay for services, estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbers’ properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said “The Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematics”. Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course, we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks. By the end, you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages, and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!

As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.

В 1736 году выдающийся математик Леонард Эйлер заинтересовался задачей и в письме другу привел строгое доказательство того, что сделать это невозможно. В том же году он доказал замечательную формулу, которая связывает число вершин, граней и ребер многогранника в трехмерном пространстве. Формула таинственным образом верна и для графов, которые называются "планарными". Эти два результата заложили основу теории графов и неплохо иллюстрируют направление ее развития по сей день. 

Граф как математический объект оказался полезным во многих теоретических и практических задачах. Наверное, дело в том, что сложность его структуры хорошо отвечает возможностям нашего мозга: это структура наглядная и понятно устроенная, но, с другой стороны, достаточно богатая, чтобы улавливать многие нетривиальные явления. Если говорить о приложениях, то, конечно, сразу же на ум приходят большие сети: Интернет, карта дорог, покрытие мобильной связи и т.п. В основах поисковых машин, таких, как Yandex и Google, лежат алгоритмы на графах. Помимо computer science, графы активно используются в биоинформатике, химии, социологии.

Этот курс служит введением в современную теорию графов. Мы, конечно, обсудим классические задачи, но и поговорим про более недавние результаты и тенденции, например, про экстремальную теорию графов. 

Материал изложен с самых основ и на доступном языке. Целью этого курса является не только познакомить вас с вопросами и методами теории графов, но и развить у неподготовленных слушателей культуру математического мышления. Поэтому курс доступен широкому кругу слушателей. Для освоения материала будет достаточно знания математики на хорошем школьном уровне и базовых знаний комбинаторики.

Курс состоит из 7 учебных недель и экзамена. Для успешного решения большинства задач из тестов достаточно освоить материал, рассказанный на лекциях. На семинарах разбираются и более сложные задачи, которые смогут заинтересовать слушателя, уже знакомого с основами теории графов.', '{"Enterprise Systems","Integrated Marketing Communications: Advertising, Public Relations, Digital Marketing and more","Procurement & Sourcing Introduction","Computational Social Science Methods","Aromatherapy: Clinical Use of Essential Oils","Information & Digital Literacy for University Success","Culminating Project in Health Informatics","Increasing Real Estate Management Profits: Harnessing Data Analytics","How Google does Machine Learning auf Deutsch","I/O-efficient algorithms","Climate Adaptation for Human Health"}', 'Sageland', 1, 799, 16, 'https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/david-irvine-cover.jpg', '{"Contrast peace","Solace europe tables consider various wlfen antony panic sixinch","Gallon terror chasing preeminent pictures hunter","Grandeur prefecture gayheader","Clean tradi capsizings despairing renown facts forms betrayed disengaged","Danced without thwack distinguish empty perched","Gathering flashing reasons armies swells bethinking lingering aptitude perhaps","Narrations bengal somebody protection froissart grand permanently beget called contains"}', 'Тг_vS', '{"Lations treats foolish steeds","Marvels rogues deceits letters","Sports furnishing \\vhalemen"}', '07:15:00-06', '21:00:00-06', '2025-12-04 20:06:27+00', '2047-03-17 15:01:35+00', '2dc3e039-ddbb-4a28-9d9f-47887d3f84ee');

Однако на  практике часто встречаются ситуации, когда дизайн сбора материала таков, что нарушение этого условия неизбежно. Представьте, что вы решили построить модель, описывающую связь успеваемости по физкультуре и величины IQ теста у студентов. Для решения этой задачи вы сделали многочисленные выборки в нескольких институтах. Можно ли объединить такие данные в один анализ, построенной по традиционной схеме? Конечно нет. Студенты в каждом вузе могут быть в чем-то сходными друг с другом. Даже характер связи между изучаемыми величинами может быть несколько разным. Такого рода данные, в которых присутствуют внутригрупповые корреляции, стоит анализировать при помощи смешанных линейных моделей. Мы покажем, что некоторые предикторы стоит включать в модель в качестве так называемых “случайных факторов”. Вы узнаете, что случайные факторы могут быть иерархически соподчинены. Мы обсудим, как такие смешанные модели могут быть построены для зависимых переменных подчиняющихся разным типам распределений. Кроме того, мы покажем, что случайная часть модели может быть устроена еще сложнее - в ней может быть компонент, моделирующий поведение дисперсии в ответ на влияние ковариаты. В конце курса вас ждет проект, в котором вы сможете потренироваться в построении смешанных моделей, выбрав один из нескольких датасетов. На основе анализа этих данных вы сможете создать отчет, выдержанный в традициях воспроизводимого исследования.

This two-part class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of "Algorithmic Thinking", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems.

In part 2 of this course, we will study advanced algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming.  As the central part of the course, students will implement several algorithms in Python that incorporate these techniques and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these algorithms.

Once students have completed this class, they will have both the mathematical and programming skills to analyze, design, and program solutions to a wide range of computational problems.  While this class will use Python as its vehicle of choice to practice Algorithmic Thinking, the concepts that you will learn in this class transcend any particular programming language.', '{"Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part II","Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part I -The Role of the State","Fundamentos de agrotecnología","Introducción al análisis de Costos para la Dirección de Empresas"}', 'Strongtown', 6, 899, 28, 'https://www.artinconnu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/monalisa.png', '{"Wretched seated badenbaden colours stiff downcast fashion steadfast including domineering shark","Weavingly animated","Misery heightens hostilely letters","Twothirds fearless holiest instantly inadequately migratory generally inflamed","Fortunes casually unnatural overscorning unalter history glimpse ideal repeat","Radney series tossings wild integrity wormpipe calamities banks chance","Prodigies cities reappeared pallid patience thanks forever scarcely workmanlike combining buffalo bethink","Noble outstrip northern awhaling towing deter spreads trades disas herent ascribe tension","Hissed elements beggar irresistible throats unexampled quarters clearly diversion making","Reaped trades tation floats"}', 'AT(2_4N', '{"Marvellous harpooneer cannibals"}', '04:00:00-08', '17:30:00-08', '2034-07-11 03:09:31+00', '2048-11-12 07:19:32+00', 'a64c83e6-32b2-4178-8ebd-90b0e0f59a7b');

-The first module identifies the needs of children and the role of the state in child development.  We will explore changes in the family and the resulting debates about how to best support families and child development.  We’ll appraise family leave and child care programs for their role in supporting paid work and in strengthening child development, as well as income support efforts including the child tax credit and proposals for a family allowance.  

-The second module begins with a description of child poverty—both the forces leading to it, and its effects.  This module also describes public support programs and critiques the debates surrounding them.

-The third module focuses on persons living with disabilities, evaluating the  landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.   We will also critique the processes of establishing a disability social insurance program and the public aid programs that make people with disabilities eligible for income support and health support.  

-The final module begins with a report on the aging of the U.S. population.  Building on this, we’ll examine social insurance programs and public aid programs for seniors for their longterm viability, and assess the various reforms that have been proposed to stabilize these programs.

The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You’ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re developing your ideas.

You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.

Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.

This course will help you to understand how to make the best of these smart technologies in your cities’ legacy infrastructures.  
Over the past few years, advances in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable land scape of urban infrastructure service provision. This has resulted in increasing interest from both technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so-called “Smart Cities”. Although such “Smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.
In this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the Smart urban infrastructures, namely Smart urban transportation and Smart urban energy systems. Over the journey of this 5-week online course you will learn about the most important principles for the management of Smart urban infrastructures as well as the applications of these principles in the transportation and energy sectors. 
This course does not have any prerequisites. However, to take the most away from of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our other MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures, which has been widely praised by learners. 
Through this course, you will:
- Gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure systems;
- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies for effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart urban systems;
- Study the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and

According to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.

The European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.

Traditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. 

The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. 

The course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.

In the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor''s perspective.

Course Format
The course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.

Suggested Readings
The course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course.

Today’s humanitarian crisis tend to be greater in number, often in urban settings, longer in duration and broader in regional impact. They generate human sufferings on a greater scale, disrupt essential services, such as water supply or sanitation and put health of large population at risk. Engineers and technical specialists in water, sanitation, energy, environment, and in other related fields play a vital role to respond to these challenges and growing needs. In the humanitarian sector, they are called the public health engineers and today they are increasingly needed! Why public health engineering matters so much in humanitarian crises?

There are four weeks of course content, which require 2-4 hours per week. Each module builds upon the previous one, so we strongly suggest you follow the sequence we''ve outlined rather than skip ahead or do the course in less time. The course is designed to give you an opportunity to learn and share with others, not test what you know. There are weekly activity and reflection assignments, but these will not be graded. To receive credit for this course, you will need to complete the peer-reviewed final assignment.

As a participant, you will:
- Watch videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium''s approach to teaching and learning 
- Conduct personal investigations by engaging in hands-on activities based in those phenomena
- Reflect and share your experience doing activities
- Discuss and identify challenges and opportunities for teaching
- Devise a lesson of your own based on one or more of the activities

Each week, we''ll look at a different light-related topic: We will start by examining human visual perception, then take a brief historical tour of our evolving scientific understanding. We’ll also look at optics and optical instruments and finish by looking at the wave nature of light. 

To get the most out of this experience, you''ll have to try out some activities! In return, you''ll get lots of valuable teaching resources, an in-depth understanding of the subject matter, and useful tips and techniques for the classroom.

NOTE: This is a hands-on workshop, so you will need to buy or find materials. All of the materials required are inexpensive and should be easy to obtain, and we welcome substitutions!

Chinese Medicine and Modern Medicine are two distinct medical systems, yet they both aim at the prevention and treatment of human diseases. With this in mind, we should understand the practice of Chinese Medicine in the context of Modern Medicine.

In this course, we explore the basic theories underlying the practice of Chinese Medicine, compare and contrast the use of Chinese Medicine and Modern Medicine in Preventive Health, and discuss how to restore a healthy condition and understand the pharmacological basis of different types of Chinese tonifying herbs.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
-              state the important Chinese Medicine literature from 5th century B.C. to 16th century A.D.
-              describe and interpret basic Chinese Medicine theories 
-              apply the basic Chinese Medicine theories (such as the balance between Yin and Yang and the interaction among organs) to restore a healthy condition
-              compare and contrast the use of Chinese Medicine and Modern Medicine in Preventive Health
-              explain how the balance of Yang/Qi and/or Yin/Blood can be restored by using Chinese tonifying herbs
-              adapt the Chinese Medicine concepts by reviewing the contemporary researches on pharmacological activities in Chinese tonifying herbs', '{"Introduction to Hearing Loss","FinTech Law and Policy"}', 'http://www.example.com/', 4, 199, 30, 'https://www.artinconnu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/monalisa.png', '{"Magistrate paddlewheels supplementary companions possible vaguely fearfully treacherously drawing hence","Larly hints","Accessible wildocean repartees eventually bartering frightens belief haunted survived","Exposed lacquered leadcoloured insult flying fidently","Woods chartering possible wherever approach believe trances diameter povelson limbered ramparts","Under still","Intermitting smiled fedallah haunted tigeryellow season deformity slashing mutinying","Pewter butts"}', 'HCiCM_6H', '{"Esti patient scales saucers","Bodily merrily resort"}', '02:45:00-07', '16:15:00-07', '2044-12-03 16:41:10+00', '2045-06-12 08:12:43+00', 'ec2bbfad-5338-444a-89ef-fb6b7bedf88e');

Маленькие дети, пытаясь добиться того, чтобы родители купили понравившуюся конфетку, часто шантажируют родителей своими слезами. Принимая решение заплакать, ребенок рискует — он не знает, как поведут себя папа с мамой. В чуть более взрослом возрасте абитуриенты, выбирающие вуз, принимают сложное решение о том, в какие университеты подать документы. Ошибка может стоить дорого: при неправильной стратегии можно оказаться в слабом университете или вообще остаться без заветного студенческого билета. Окончив вуз, юноши и девушки начинают искать работу. Перед интервью с работодателем они штудируют статьи в интернете о том, что можно и чего нельзя говорить на интервью, — они пытаются найти наилучшую стратегию своего поведения, исходя из ожиданий компании, в которую они устраиваются. Все эти ситуации объединяет то, что решения, которые принимают одни люди, оказывают влияние на других людей. Такие взаимодействия называются стратегическими. Именно их изучает теория игр.

Чтобы проанализировать ту или иную реальную жизненную ситуацию стратегического взаимодействия и найти оптимальный вариант поведения в ней, необходимо сделать две вещи. Во-первых, необходимо формально записать ситуацию на языке теории игр, то есть создать модель (игру). Во-вторых, после того как модель (игра) составлена, ее необходимо решить. Этому мы будем учиться в течение курса. Мы разберем основные виды игр (одновременные и последовательные, с совершенной и несовершенной информацией, коалиционные и некоалиционные), приведем способы их решения и обсудим их на многочисленных примерах.

Курс будет интересен желающим разобраться в том, как конкурируют друг с другом несколько компаний и можно ли гарантированно выиграть в шашки, есть ли смысл угрожать на переговорах и с кем стоит объединяться в коалиции в парламенте.

A proliferation of global brands brings diverse cultures to a consumer population that is also growing culturally diverse. This course enables students to understand how globalization changes consumers at a psychological level, and provides tools for imbuing brands with cultural meanings—creating iconic brands—that can resonate with global consumers. The focus is on understanding that culture exists in the mind (e.g., values and beliefs) as well as in the environment (e.g., objects, brands, and institutions), and that globalization creates multi-cultural spaces in contemporary societies. Consumers can use the cultural meaning of a brand to build their identities (i.e., assimilate the brand cultural symbolism) or reject the brand’s cultural meaning(s) (i.e., exclusionary reactions).

The course will help students identify when assimilation vs. exclusionary reactions are more likely to occur, as well as devise strategies for imbuing brands with cultural meanings that can elevate them to the status of cultural icons. 

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
•	Understand how globalization impacts the psychological responses of consumers in global markets 
•	Understand what culture is and how it manifests itself 
•	Understand how brands acquire cultural meanings 
•	Predict consumers’ responses to the cultural meanings in brands 
•	Identify strategies to win-over multi-cultural consumers in globalized markets 
•	Learn how to build an iconic brand

But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.
 
In Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data.
