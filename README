This is a starter project to build new services off of. Code sharing between microservices usually leads to tight-coupling
of services. In order to avoid coupling by using a common library, we decided to use a starter codebase. All new services
should simply copy this project and rename the root package name to match the project groupId. Further, configuration 
properties needed for bootstrapping are now environment variables. The following environment variables need to be set:

SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME=course
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_URI=http://localhost:8888
SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_ENABLED=true
SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_FAIL_FAST=true
GIT_REMOTE=git@bitbucket.org:modern-lms/codegen.git
COMMIT_MESSAGE="Add Course Service codegen files"
ARTIFACT_DIR=artifacts/course

The variable values are for example purposes only. The actual values should correspond to the specific service. 

After copying the project, makes changes in the following areas:
1. Maven pom.xml files: project group id
2. Codegen module: package name in OpenApi configurations in the pom file
3.
